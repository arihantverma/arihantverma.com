I'm Arihant. It means one who has conquered his mind. I'm a non stick pan to events ðŸ¥˜ ðŸŸ©

I am a front end engineer at Goibibo. I'm looking for my next web front end gig. My [resume](/resume).

I like to read other people's code, learn from it, and make videos about or write about it.

I read and write a lot of short stories, novels and poetry. A weekly list of literature and art suggestions coming soon.

I write because it keeps me honest to myself and because I like to write stories which help people become free of concern.

Look out for this web space for

- Book Reviews, Book Suggestions
- React, Javascript, CSS
- Deep run downs of open source code
