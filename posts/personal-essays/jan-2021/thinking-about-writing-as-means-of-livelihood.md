<!--
I've a strong urge to not work for an organisation or company, at least the ones whose sole purpose is to earn more profits year over year. Which is most of the market. Many reasons, but top among them¬†‚Äî I want to do that for myself, not for the company. Problem is you've got to practice and learn doing that. One could either keep going on in companies and learning and finally define a moment of absolute quitting, or learn it on one's own ‚Äî struggling a little more. -->

I hate deadlines for something I've to keep a conscious commitment over ‚Äì like a job's work. But ironically that's exactly from where commitment in general becomes strong ‚Äì by doing something despite not having any particular liking towards it. That's the only way to make habits. Habits are the only way to sustain commitments and to get work done.

If you work in an organisation, one of the best things that could happen to you is to be friends, or at least be in good terms, with senior leadership person(s). When that happens, accountability comes, understanding of business increases exponentially. You don't always feel the mechanical nature of a full time job. But I've never made efforts to have that. My bad. That accountability that comes with always being in a good eye of that person, along with deadlines and getting work done faster go hand in hand towards

Deadlines on a personal projects however are non existent, because I'm always working on them out of my own excited will. Which also means they get more out of me, more quickly. That's what started to make me think a couple of months ago. Even if there'd be an initial struggle, wouldn't long term benefits come more quickly?

I best enjoy deadlines when I'm able to practice them on my own. Why shouldn't I leverage that more often.

Ever since December last year, I've established one thing ‚Äì¬†whatever I do, if I don't find ways to earn an income on my own by the side, I'm going to keep having constant urges to quit. So this year I decided to start.

I'm a writer. I write [short stories](/posts/2021/01/14/changing-narration-voices-and-tenses/), [poetry](/writing), [essays](/tags) and technical articles about code gymnastics. Writing is one occupation I've always wanted to do more ‚Äì not for the money ‚Äì but because I just love writing. I made two goals for myself. I want to get paid writing two kinds of articles.

1. Writing for news / literary magazines.
2. Writing for tech / coding magazines.

I want to read more literature. The best way to do that is to write about what I read, and find places to get paid for it whenever possible. Getting paid for literature and alike articles is less about having a source of income and more an incentive to keep writing more.

I want to write more about code, because I want to read and understand more code. Reading code gives far more perspective than being able to do it on my own. Don't get me wrong. It's a üê• and ü•ö problem. If you don't try things on your own ‚Äî¬†your creativity suffers. But if you don't read code, you don't get to learn the best ways of doing something. I do both. I sometimes search for a piece of code which will help me learn the best way to do it. Other times, I try first and then go on a look out.

The best way to always have to keep doing the both ‚Äî read other people's code and write your own to build something which works well ‚Äî¬†is to write about all of it. I recently pitched an article to Smashing Magazine and got accepted. They pay for each article you write. I now have more incentive to learn and build more, to be able to write about it.

At work I do not get to read a lot of code. Though from time to time I get to solve interesting problems, they are a minority in terms of my majority work. I've seen numerous people who ‚Äî through hardwork and pure consistency and discpline ‚Äî¬†have managed to make reading code, creating products and open source software, and then creating videos / writing articles / making podcasts about it their full time job. The best thing ‚Äî their networks are largest in the community.

I'm asking myself _Why not me?_. I thought it was high time I started making efforts to ensure that I'm able to start doing the same in 2-3 years time.

make something self sustaining ‚û°Ô∏è earn through it ‚û°Ô∏è invest it back in learning ‚û°Ô∏è make something else with that learning ‚û°Ô∏è ‚àû

This year I only have one resolution ‚Äî¬†establish this cycle.
