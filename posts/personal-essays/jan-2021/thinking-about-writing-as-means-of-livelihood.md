<!--
I've a strong urge to not work for an organisation or company, at least the ones whose sole purpose is to earn more profits year over year. Which is most of the market. Many reasons, but top among them¬†‚Äî I want to do that for myself, not for the company. Problem is you've got to practice and learn doing that. One could either keep going on in companies and learning and finally define a moment of absolute quitting, or learn it on one's own ‚Äî struggling a little more. -->

I hate deadlines for something I've to keep a conscious commitment over ‚Äì like a job's work. But ironically that's where commitment in general becomes strong ‚Äì by doing something despite not having any particular liking towards it. One of the best things that could happen to a person having a full time job is to be a friend to a senior leadership person. When that happens, accountability comes, understanding of business increases exponentially. But I've never made efforts to have that. My bad.

Deadlines on a personal projects however are non existent, because I'm always working on them out of my own excited will. Which also means they get more out of me, more quickly. That's what started to make me think a couple of months ago. Even if there'd be an initial struggle, wouldn't long term benefits come more quickly?

I best enjoy deadlines when I'm able to practice them on my own. Why shouldn't I leverage that more often.

Ever since December last year, I've established one thing ‚Äì¬†whatever I do, if I don't find ways to earn an income on my own by the side, I'm going to keep having constant urges to quit. So this year I decided to start.

I'm a writer. I write [short stories](/posts/2021/01/14/changing-narration-voices-and-tenses/), [poetry](/writing) and [essays](/tags) and technical articles about code gymnastics. Writing is one occupation I've always wanted to do more ‚Äì not for the money ‚Äì but because I just love writing. I made two goals for myself. I want to get paid writing two kinds of articles.

1. Writing for news / literary magazines.
2. Writing for tech / coding magazines.

I want to read more literature. The best way to do that is to write about what I read, and find places to get paid for it, if possible. _If possible_, is important, because I know if I keep writing, I'll eventually be able to write stories that'd sell. Not as a primary goal, but as a secondary goal of being able to write better and better.

I want to write more about code, because I want to read code more. Reading code gives far more perspective than being able to do it on your own. Don't get me wrong. It's a üê• and ü•ö problem. If you don't try things on your own ‚Äî¬†your creativity suffers. But if you don't read code, you don't get to learn the best ways of doing something. I do both. I sometimes search for a piece of code which will help me.

I love to understand code and write about it. When there's a push to write code for something you love working on, reading other people's code becomes a given. You read as much as you write, so that you could learn better ways to do things. For example, for this blog, I wanted to create a search button, which would share to twitter if web share api wasn't present, and would open the default share dialogue for mobile browsers where web share api would be available. I clicked on the share button on [web.dev](https://web.dev) and they were having the exact same functionality. I went through a [web component](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/web.dev/blob/603a318d27d3152ee4f8aabb56370219c2832258/src/lib/components/ShareAction/index.js) written by Google Chrome Dev Rel team for [web.dev](https://web.dev), and tinkered it to my own needs.

At work I do not get to read a lot of code. Though from time to time I get to solve interesting problems, they are a minority in terms of my majority work. I've seen numerous people who ‚Äî through hardwork and pure consistency and discpline ‚Äî¬†have managed to make reading code and creating something with it, and then creating videos / writing articles / making podcasts about it their full time job.

I thought it was high time I started making efforts to ensure that I'm able to start doing the same in 2-3 years time.

I started with where I left things in December. In August last year, I made a video about [making reusable breadcrumb components with compound components pattern in react](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9K7el0LTIA&ab_channel=ArihantVerma). It surprisingly got more views than I thought it would ‚Äì about 1.2k. That had given me a push that more people are looking to read about more 'production ready' code and practices than ever. In December, I had the idea about converting the video in the written format. I searched about publications who compensate for the articles. I stumbled upon Smashing Magazine. Some of the Smashing Magazine's staff works full time. They get 100s of submissions everyday. Which means they have to set up filtering mechanism so that they could really focus on original ideas worth pursuing. Their process involves having to write a detailed outline about the article you want to pitch, and answering some questions like _Who is the target audience for the article, and what level of experience is it aimed at?_, _What will the target audience take away from reading the article?_, _Why are you the best person to write this article? Include links to other writing, and details of your own expertise._

I spent a day writing a detailed pitch, and a week later it got accepted. Smashing Magazines pays all its writers. This is a perfect motivation. Motivations are short lived are not scalable or sustainable. But when motivation is driven by a personal benefit, it becomes more powerful. The by product of the result of that motivation ‚Äì¬†the money ‚Äî¬†helps me learn new things and apply them in my own projects. Who knows I'd be able to create a self sustaining indie hacker project, which will help me invest back into learning more. It's a sweet cycle to think about.

make something self sustaining ‚û°Ô∏è earn through it ‚û°Ô∏è invest it back in learning ‚û°Ô∏è make something else with that learning ‚û°Ô∏è ‚àû
