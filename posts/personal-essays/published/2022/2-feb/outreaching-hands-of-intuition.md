## The Dance Of Desire

> A desire comes up and arrests your senses.

At my first job, I had a desktop. Most of the others in the team had a mac book pro. I wanted it. I had a college laptop at home whose screen had gone rogue and green. One evening, tired of using the laptop on an external glaring TV screen, I gave in. I bought a late 2015, 13 inch, 8GB RAM mac book pro. After the purchase, not able to survive the guilt of my first expensive shopaholic purchase, I called my father. He asked me to consider it as a gift and sent me half the money.

I can't begin to tell how many times the thought of leaving a job has come to mind. Some of those times I acted out on them, leaving three jobs, without a prior plan or any job offer.

Even now that I'm earning better than before and have no major complains about salary, this thought is omnipresent — for different justifications the mind provides as reasons. It's stubborn on days, and just floating around on the periphery on the others. One would think that if a thought so throbbing, incessant, is extant, it might be sort of a calling, or a warning, an omen, or an intuition.


## The Hum Of The Moment

In the background of living our lives resides a silent hum of _it's okay, never mind and so what_. It might be difficult to feel when there's too much going on inside and outside of you. But if you roll around your eyes in the past, it might be looking right at you. You've experienced this. This hum is the hum of this moment, asking you to bathe in it and just be.

For example, my steps imbibe dance when I walk with my headphones on, not caring about the eyes around. Sometimes I sing aloud too. I forget I'm outside. This happens because I'm totally in the moment, I'm inside myself so to speak. This happens because I'm able to let go.

Experiencing this hum of the moment frequently – everyday – is necessary to not feel overwhelmed by the thoughts that arouse desire, but at the same time not completely ignore the desires. Desires are necessary for the world to exist and sustain. But how do we do that? How do we not get affected by them and still indulge in them and gauge which ones are worth acting upon? How do we trigger our intellect without giving into the mind's bias for convenience and languor? One word – [_'meditation'_](https://arihantverma.com/posts/2021/12/26/why-is-sudarshan-kriya-like-brushing/).

## The Middle Path — Precursor

Like the thought of quitting my job, _so that I could follow my dreams of becoming an author_, our mind vacillates between extremes, as if vacillating between past and the future constantly isn't enough. The constant drumming of the thoughts, specially the ones that enervate: thoughts that express complaints, ambitions, passion, anger, grudge, fear, etc… are gruelling. You've work to do, but you need to rest, because you haven't slept in 3 days, but you can't, because you have work. Life just doesn't come to a stop. Besides, your friends and your partner are becoming distant because you are not able to give enough time.

It is in moments like these that you wish you were a child or a teen again. In moments like this where you wish different scenarios for yourself. If those desires don't arise in you, you might never act upon them. Yet at the same time, they are difficult thoughts — since, in this job example — it's difficult to acknowledge and be aware of the fact that you are getting churned, and are not able to do anything enough about it.

But there's a middle way. I recently realised this. A way backed by intuition, laid by persistence and commitment, maintained by centeredness, sustained by patience, and celebrated by small wins on the run.

## The Middle Path

The middle path is that of moderation and letting go periodically. In a way you could say that it the path of being a yogi. When thrusting, persistent desires and thoughts keep you busy, having a mind which is centered, turns that insistence into a weapon. The weapon feels like having ginger lemon honey concoction on your tongue as you wade through whatever life throws at you, no matter what. It feels like a super power. Desires no longer demands attention, you get the power to keep gurgling them in your throat on the side. You set your priorities right, make smart trade offs, work towards your goals, habit acted after habit.

On this path, you know that

> We've had so many desires, but all of them lead to the same place…the beginning.

So you sit and assume you already have a particular desire fulfilled and you observe how that makes you feel.

Buddha never knew what death was. Astrologers and priests told his parents that Buddha should never see death. If he sees death then you will lose him. But one day Buddha compelled by his charioteer to take him out, and when he went out, he saw an old person for the first time in his life. He asked charioteer about it. His chatrioteer said, _He is an old man and that is what we will all be one day_. Buddha was a young boy, just 20 years old. When he heard that, he said, _I've  already become old. If this is what is going to happen for sure, then it has already happened._ Then he saw a corpse, and asked what it was. His charioteer said, _This also will happen to everybody. When you are dead four people will carry you and you will be cremated._ Buddha said, _I am already dead. I have that experience right now._

If the mind is sharp, you don't wait for experience to happen to you. Anyone's experience becomes your experience.

This middle is trying, demands discipline, but handles stress and pressure exquisitely. The only way to keep going on this path is by having gratitude, being contented, having patience and cut throat perseverance. _Oh BS!_ You might be inclined to say. This all sounds so abstract and general. And like a gazillion other things, the experience of each one of us is so different because we have different socio-economical, emotional, financial circumstances. But there's a common string that goes right through the middle of this path that can be felt by everyone.


## The Overarching, Outreaching Hands Of Intuition

How to find a good tomato in a farm of thousands of rotten tomatoes? Intuition. 





<!-- ## When Buddha Said _"I'm Already That"_

Over these years, after numerous mistakes, I've found that there's a small way in which intuition could be detected. Since acting on every desire leads to the same place – the beginning – you could just imagine how you'd feel like when that desire got fulfilled by imagining that it has already happened.

<!-- ## Intuition Needs Frequently Letting Go

Now that we at least have a hint about our intuitions, how to build it?

We've all had these bouts of extremely mysterious experiences where we are not able to remember something but are trying very hard to. The moment we let go it comes back to us. In life, like everything else, the art of letting go has to be practiced. Intuition and letting go periodically go hand in hand. The mind needs space to be able to have clarity. That space gets build only when we truly let go of everything for a while, everyday. [Learning how to meditate]((https://arihantverma.com/posts/2021/12/26/why-is-sudarshan-kriya-like-brushing/), and meditating is the only way I know where that space is created effortlessly.

The dreams, recurrent thoughts wanting impulsive or necessary actions out of you can become wonderful if you let them co exist with you instead of giving too much attention to them all the time. Intuition builds in this ability to walk on the middle path. -->

<!-- 

That is only possible when we choose to be happy and smile even when situations and people demand otherwise. Only possible when we practice living in the present moment.

> When we listen to our intuition, the action that supports it doesn't have to be spontaneous and immediate. It can be spontaenous and planned, spiced up with calculated risk.

My steps imbibe dance when I walk with my headphones on. Sometimes I sing aloud, not caring about the eyes around. More exactly, forgetting I'm outside. This happens because I'm totally in the moment, because I'm able to let go.

Ultimately we don't have forever. So let's choose the middle path, set our priorities right, not only on paper but in actions as well.

So, I'm going to buy that silver glossiness of a computer, or quit job anytime soon. But I'm going to write and create a lot and keep a look out for the time when I'll be able to.

<!-- 6 years have passed. 2 months ago, that laptop died beyond repair. I realised then that unlike how I would have felt or reacted even three years ago, I didn't feel sad. There was no desire that replaced it with wanting to buy the latest, best, 16inch, 32GB RAM mac book pro glossiness, that would cost me the annual in hand salary of my first job. Okay, okay. It did occur for a bit, resulting in checking the model out online, and going so far as to add it in the cart. But I didn't buy it. There was no need to. I have an office laptop, so why go do prodical shoppaholic regretful shenanigans. -->
