## My Resignation Mail

Hey {% blur "Boss's_Name" "10px" "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)"%},

Thanks a lot for the conversation that we had at the start of the last week. It gave me a sense of direction and of course very concerned, empathetic and encouraging advice from you.

I was up for most nights this week, some nights because I had to take care of two ailing family members, other nights because I had to think about what I had to do. I thought pragmatically. I've decided that I want to put my papers right now. Please consider this email as my formal notice of resignation. I would request that my last working day be Feb 1st, 2021, allowing me 1.5 months of transition time, if possible, for the urgent personal reason discussed over call last week. For a short recap of it, if this mail needs to be shared anywhere, primarily reason for this decision has been to support my younger brother studying abroad, by getting a job there. For a variety of reasons, he's had to start from scratch and had had an excruciatingly tough time.

Following are my thoughts after our last discussion.

It's becoming unmanageable to work and handle things at home and with fluctuating and erratic situations coming from every which way. I've persevered through months of this. However, neither personal challenges, nor the wanting to take the next career step to find a job outside of India for financial reasons, are the sole reasons for my decision. Read on.

To ascertain my decision to leave and to establish that I am not leaving only because of tough situations – emotional, financial, mental, and others – I thought hard about what I might have done 6 months down the line, had all the puddles of challenges I'm finding myself in hadn't been there.

Working at Goibibo has given me a lot of perspective and skills. I’ve learnt how to prioritize, learn from each other, really make an impact in helping people book in the best way possible, and make stunning and loving friends along the way. I’ve had the privilege to work on revamp projects from their inception. Goibibo and my team members gave me a playground with room to learn and implement. I may not have made the best of it, but I think I did decent. My proudest moments are those days where I could enable another person to do what only I had the knowledge of till that point in time.

As you'd have already sensed from my efforts, I've a way of deep diving into things. I like to research, I'm interested in code infrastructure, language design, helping make things which help other developers make better applications on top of it. I'm interested in tooling, writing, researching, exploring, teaching and implementing. My career goals for my future are different from my role in the company.

I haven’t had career goals before I was forced to think about them by this uncanny time and circumstances. It obviously feels different and sometimes even fearful, but change always makes one feel like so. There’s also a relief in knowing what kind of work I’d want to move towards, which I didn’t know before.

This transition forced me to think about what I wanted to do in my career, and how I wanted to do it in the long term. After talking to a lot of old mentors, and reading a lot of literature about coding careers, I've realised that though I might not be able to work on all my interests right away, I've to make efforts to start somewhere. This is the first thoughtful step I’m taking towards what I want to do.

Of course, the decision to leave is backed by financial and emotional urgency right now, and a righteous one at that. But I thought why not take this opportunity in disguise to really think things through.

I hope this email has answered most, if not all the answers that anybody else might need during the exit process.

Last thing I wanted to touch in this mail is about the appraisal. I’ve worked hard in bringing mweb and dweb along with my team – to the point of reading open-source code and taking inspiration from it to implement robust code, and teaching it to others. I've been at the forefront in keeping the code standards in the codebases. I deserve a chance to be awarded for my efforts, given appraisal was postponed because of covid. If you could see the possibility of it, I’d be grateful. I don’t know what the rules for it are for a person serving notice period, but I had to ask.

Rest assured, I've given this decision peaceful thought and is not taken with an unsorted mind or in haste.

This is what I had to inform through this mail. Thank you for reading through. Please guide me for the next step to take.

Regards,
Arihant
