{% note "Note: This is a rant. Please read at your own discretion." %}

I have never talked much. The last time I met some of my high school friends in 2017, they celebrated midly when I indulged in a conversation, saying _{% inlineDoubleQuotes "Oh my freaking God, spoke!" %}_. I've never gotten into fights, I never argue about things that I stand up for ( because there are so few ). I don't go out much ( pre covid ). In a room full of people and buzz, be it in office, at a house party, or even a social gathering of like minded people, I'd remain silent for most of the time.

I remember a time when I had a week's work with me at office on that Monday, and I didn't speak a single word with anybody for that entire week. I started feeling nauseous mentally. I started feeling jittery. My mind started goofing up making scenarios and statements which I had no method to confirm. I got really worked up about the fact that no one was checking on my work, and they suddenly would, and I'd be caught off red handed, not having completed it.

Even in a social gathering where I'd have something in common with a lot of people, if somebody would initiate a small talk, I'd freeze. After some awkward exchange to eventually die, I'd be back to not speaking.

Since I've never really spoken with people about things that'd instigate action, creation, learning, discussion, polite healthy arguments, this year I found myself troubled by how much I should have known and didn't know.

Doubt creeped in like angry üçØüêùs inside the house. I doubted if I had been a good son, a good brother, a good friend to others, and I got gigantic NOs to all of those. More, I didn't know how to change that. So not knowing what to do, I just started down the memory lane.

Before 10th grade, I had friends. I'd have school to look forward to, marks to get, a class of 40 some people to top. I'd have basketball and cricket to play in the mornings and evenings. After I went away from home after 10th grade, I started becoming reticent. Kota was a newly found freedom, with lovely friends who'd stay for a year. But along with it came endless hours of studying which I didn't set my mind to.

I would skip doing the daily practice problems, I'd spend hours on an {% footnoteref "addiction" "I'm writing an article for a culture mag/website about it, and am not ready to speak about it publicly yet." %} addiction {% endfootnoteref %}. I'd waste time on movies. I would not have control over my senses. If I had to sit and study for an hour, I wouldn't be able to. Would be too easily distracted.

No surprise that I wasn't able to crack most of the prestigious engineering entrace exams, despite being smart, having an inclination towards what I studied. There was lack of practice, lack of tactics, lack of goals and working towards them, lack of habits.

From then onwards I was on auto pilot. Graduated from college with a decent grade, decent bourgeois job. Didn't have career goals right from the start. It and some other factors led to wanting to [quit the first job](http://gdad-s-river.github.io/blog/goodbye-sapient), staying unemployed in an ennui for 1.8 years.

For a brief moment after I managed to get a job back in Oct 2018, I thought I'd have it now. But the rut of the job, and not having commitments for the things that matter to me ( read code, make stuff, write and read a lot ) brought me back to square one. Amidst this I even stopped exploring and reading about new technologies. I don't even know when that happened.

I suddenly realised this when all the people I was surrounded with and had a safety net of, quit the company this year. People I look upto and respect a lot, and have learnt tons from. I realised the repercussions of not having career goals, and not working everyday as if the work that I'd do would be needed for an interview the next day. I realised how stupid I had been considering I'm at least 3.5 years behind in the pay scale range from the market average.

The day it happened, I remembered all those instances when I had see batchmates from college studying or working outside, in ivy league universities and doing stunning work at companies. I'd shut my phone down. I wouldn't be able to handle it. But I'd remember the drive, ambition and purpose all of those batchmates had in college, and I'd wonder why I didn't have it, why I didn't have goals ‚Äì financial, career, life's.

I was doing everything without a sense of direction and purpose. How could I be going anywhere other than every whichway?

I was given untamed freedom by my parents right from childhood. I didn't see how lucky I've always been in this regard. And it pinches to write it down, that though I've not misused that freedom in any extreme way, I didn't use it for what it existed.

I'm 26, and having been in love has had its own challenges. I'm not the best communicator, best confidant. I run away from difficult talks in a relationship. I'm also afraid that I'd say things that would not make sense. It's like walking on a rope thin ridge, steep slope on one side, river on the other. This is the stage of life where marriage constantly keeps coming into picture ‚Äì someone or the others keeps talking about it. It's stressful and difficult to realise that I'm ready for it yet. I'm at best a person who can speak something and calm somebody down by the virtue of my polite inherit voice. That's all I've been useful for. Thank goodness for that.

In short I've been afraid to try things out, and failed without trying.

2020 opened my eyes, literally. Everytime I don't have the leverage of wasting time but an urge to, I don't. I can't. Otherwise it gets difficult to live the very next moment. There's always responsibility to take, and I had been sitting unaware. 2020 jolted me into putting in action that <ins>**With taking responsibility comes more power**</ins>. Spider man was wrong. And it also realised that taking responsibility is a good thing, it's not a burden.

## A Little Story For Ya

{% assign tundraPradesh = "Tundra is a barren cold environment/place. Pradesh in Hindi means province/territory and is the last name of many Indian states" %}

I come to my mother's room and my mother mumbles a wish to drink milk outloud, to herself. _{% inlineDoubleQuotes 'I want to drink milk. How shall I go downstairs‚Ä¶' %}_. She calls me and half heartedly asks if I could go and get it for her. _"Arihant‚Ä¶"_

And then she trails off saying, _{% doubleQuotesPaired %}‚Ä¶ no never mind, it's {% footnoteref "tundra-pradesh" tundraPradesh %}Tundra Pradesh{% endfootnoteref %} down there, don't go.{% enddoubleQuotesPaired %}_

I ask if I should go get her milk for her, I say, _{% inlineDoubleQuotes "I really could go, I'll go wear the thick jacket, don't worry" %}_. She keeps denying, so that I don't catch cold in stone cold kitchen downstairs at 0&deg; celcius. I keep insisting that she least me go, asking _{% inlineDoubleQuotes "Are you sure?" %}_. She snaps at me and says _{% inlineDoubleQuotes "Stop being so overtly sensitive Arihant. You've to be stern at times, stand by what you want to do, even if it goes against other people's wishes, even mine" %}_.

I recently quit my job, so that I find a better paying one ( not a good reason to change jobs, but desperate needs call for desperate measures ). My brother has had to start over after 3 years of struggling, trying to do decent in Computer Engineering. So I want to support him to do what he wants, so that he has the freedom to fail, something I had but didn't avail. I also quit because I'm done being afraid to do my things. This website is the first project out of that valour.

## My Resgination Mail

 Hey {% blur "Abhishek" "5px" "rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)"%},

Thanks a lot for the conversation that we had at the start of the last week. It gave me a sense of direction and of course very concerned, empathetic and encouraging advice from you.

I was up for most nights this week, some nights because I had to take care of two ailing family members, other nights because I had to think about what I had to do. I thought pragmatically. I've decided that I want to put my papers right now. Please consider this email as my formal notice of resignation. I would request that my last working day be Feb 1st, 2021, allowing me 1.5 months of transition time, if possible, for the urgent personal reason discussed over call last week. For a short recap of it, if this mail needs to be shared anywhere, primarily reason for this decision has been to support my younger brother studying abroad, by getting a job there. For a variety of reasons, he's had to start from scratch and had had an excruciatingly tough time.

Following are my thoughts after our last discussion.

It's becoming unmanageable to work and handle things at home and with fluctuating and erratic situations coming from every which way. I've persevered through months of this. However, neither personal challenges, nor the wanting to take the next career step to find a job outside of India for financial reasons, are the sole reasons for my decision. Read on.

To ascertain my decision to leave and to establish that I am not leaving only because of tough situations ‚Äì emotional, financial, mental, and others ‚Äì I thought hard about what I might have done 6 months down the line, had all the puddles of challenges I'm finding myself in hadn't been there.

Working at Goibibo has given me a lot of perspective and skills. I‚Äôve learnt how to prioritize, learn from each other, really make an impact in helping people book in the best way possible, and make stunning and loving friends along the way. I‚Äôve had the privilege to work on revamp projects from their inception. Goibibo and my team members gave me a playground with room to learn and implement. I may not have made the best of it, but I think I did decent. My proudest moments are those days where I could enable another person to do what only I had the knowledge of till that point in time.

As you'd have already sensed from my efforts, I've a way of deep diving into things. I like to research, I'm interested in code infrastructure, language design, helping make things which help other developers make better applications on top of it. I'm interested in tooling, writing, researching, exploring, teaching and implementing. My career goals for my future are different from my role in the company.

I haven‚Äôt had career goals before I was forced to think about them by this uncanny time and circumstances. It obviously feels different and sometimes even fearful, but change always makes one feel like so. There‚Äôs also a relief in knowing what kind of work I‚Äôd want to move towards, which I didn‚Äôt know before.

This transition forced me to think about what I wanted to do in my career, and how I wanted to do it in the long term. After talking to a lot of old mentors, and reading a lot of literature about coding careers, I've realised that though I might not be able to work on all my interests right away, I've to make efforts to start somewhere. This is the first thoughtful step I‚Äôm taking towards what I want to do.

Of course, the decision to leave is backed by financial and emotional urgency right now, and a righteous one at that. But I thought why not take this opportunity in disguise to really think things through.

I hope this email has answered most, if not all the answers that anybody else might need during the exit process.

Last thing I wanted to touch in this mail is about the appraisal. I‚Äôve worked hard in bringing mweb and dweb along with my team ‚Äì to the point of reading open-source code and taking inspiration from it to implement robust code, and teaching it to others. I've been at the forefront in keeping the code standards in the codebases. I deserve a chance to be awarded for my efforts, given appraisal was postponed because of covid. If you could see the possibility of it, I‚Äôd be grateful. I don‚Äôt know what the rules for it are for a person serving notice period, but I had to ask.

Rest assured, I've given this decision peaceful thought and is not taken with an unsorted mind or in haste.

This is what I had to inform through this mail. Thank you for reading through. Please guide me for the next step to take.

Regards,
Arihant
