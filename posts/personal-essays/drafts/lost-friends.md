I'm sure there are chances that you might have had memories from you childhood and college days visit you more often in the pandemic than before. Good memories have a way to resurface in emergency situations. As we are wrapped up in the four walls of our rooms and a present to the future, I too had urges to go back in time and relive some of the moments with good friends from childhood and college. It's difficult to come out of them, there's a guilty pleasure to daydream about them.

My best friend from childhood Ishpreet is engaged and is getting hitched soon. I met and talked with him 3.5 years back the last time. We spent a lot of evenings together.
